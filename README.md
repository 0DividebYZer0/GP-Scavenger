## Usage

> General Notes:
- Homebrew and NPM are used for services and package managers
- In terminal, npm install will be required in two places: within the client folder (package.json generated by React Native), and within the server folder (package.json generated for server and database use).
```sh
npm install
```
- There are also multiple .gitignore files.

## Requirements

## Development

### Installing Dependencies

> Project is written in React Native. Here are the steps to set up an environment to work in React Native. (base reference link: https://facebook.github.io/react-native/releases/0.23/docs/android-setup.html)
> 
> for macOS developers, working on an Android App:

- Android SDK (by installing Android Studio 2.3.3 for macOS)
- Configure the Android SDK: React Native supports Android 6.0 (API 23) at the time of this writing. Install the Android SDK files for 6.0 (System Image, Tools, etc.)
- Update environment variables for Android SDK: (in .bash_profile for macOS users). "ANDROID_HOME" should point to the path in given by the SDK manager (where SDK is located).
```sh
# Android SDK
export ANDROID_HOME=~/Library/Android/sdk
export PATH=${PATH}:${ANDROID_HOME}/tools:${ANDROID_HOME}/platform-tools
export PATH="$HOME/Android/tools:$PATH"
export PATH="$HOME/Android/platform-tools:$PATH"
```
- VirtualBox 5.1.26 platform packages (Genymotion requires this for macOS)
- Genymotion 2.10.0 Revision 20170719-0eb896a (Android Emulator)
- Genymotion Configuration: Create an Android Emulator running Android 6.0 (API 23).
- Recommended (but unused): Gradle
